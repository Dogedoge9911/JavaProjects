# JavaProjects
Some java projects I tried with the help of the internet
First project I tried was the classic snake game
Contains assest for the snake game which includes the apple, snake head and body, and the board. The other two projects are Swift. I learned how to do Swift thanks to the free online program "Hacking With Swift."
